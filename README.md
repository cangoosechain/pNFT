# NFT Inheritance

NFT's inheritant function to be coded by Chialisp.

## Description

* The owner of pNFT is required to encrypt his/her private keys, seeds, and passphrases in the pNFT by coding even in different shares. These shares are distributed to the stakeholders and one Validation Share is stored on the Chia blockchain. Once the ownerâ€™s decease is confirmed, the legal entity unlocks the Validation share. Subsequently, it combines all the remaining shares to unveil the passwords and private keys to the assets. 
* When the owner of pNFT is legal representative, he is also required to encrypt his/her private keys, sees, and passphrases and the heir's required information are all coded in the pNFT by Chialisp. This pNFT would be passed down to his/her heir automatically when his/her power is confirmed to be dismissed.
