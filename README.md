# pNFT

The pNFT is a kind of governance NFT coded by Chialisp on Chia Network, which has three functions: puzzle like voting mechanism, fractional and inheritance.

## Description

* CANGOOSE’s governance pNFT is using the Green blockchain Chia Network as infrastructure, create pNFT(puzzleNFT) model, fully utilize its puzzle like voting, fractional rights and transferable inheritance, to empower the transformation for enterprises into decentralized autonomous organization(DAO). For example, For example: in a automotive vehicle manufactory, a employee in a production department for making parts, can vote his or her right to a upper management using pNFT governance right all the way to CANGOOSE. In order to improve a smarter management environment for business operation and increase liquidity, CANGOOSE will separate this pNFT for the business into governance right and digital asset two parts. During this process, business will result in a smarter management at no additional cost.Puzzle like voting can ensure voting in a smart reliable way; fractional rights can benefit governance rights and encourage a better reward system; transferable inheritance can solve the pain point of loosing digital asset due to unexpected event. Through smart contract, CANGOOSE can help business mandate its governance right and inheritance, when a preset condition triggers, the smart contract will implement the specified closure.
* The owner of pNFT is required to encrypt his/her private keys, seeds, and passphrases in the pNFT by coding even in different shares. These shares are distributed to the stakeholders and one Validation Share is stored on the Chia blockchain. Once the owner’s decease is confirmed, the legal entity unlocks the Validation share. Subsequently, it combines all the remaining shares to unveil the passwords and private keys to the assets. When the owner of pNFT is legal representative, he is also required to encrypt his/her private keys, sees, and passphrases and the heir's required information are all coded in the pNFT by Chialisp. This pNFT would be passed down to his/her heir automatically when his/her power is confirmed to be dismissed.
